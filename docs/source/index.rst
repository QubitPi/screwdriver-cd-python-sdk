    * Since methods with two underscores (`__`) cannot be tested due to the
      `name mangling <https://qubitpi.github.io/cpython/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables>`_. We require
      all private methods and attributes to be prefixed with **single underscore prefix (`_`) only**
    * The phrase "Chinese" used throughout this documentation referse to "**Simplified Chinese**", instead of
      "Traditional Chinese"
